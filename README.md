A Partial Order Causal-Link (POCL) Planner implemented with Python 3. POCL is a search through plan-space where each child node in the search resolves some flaw of its parent node. Program terminates when 'k' leaves are found with no flaws. Each operator from the domain is preprocessed with the problem atoms into ground steps.
